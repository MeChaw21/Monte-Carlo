# Monte-Carlo sample mean
Estimating the integral of 4 * (1 - x^2)^1/2 in the range 0 to 1 using Monte Carlo (sample mean) method. The integral is evaluated by taking 1000 points per iteration and repeating this 1000 times. The standard deviation of the functional evaluations and the over all standard deviation is calculated
